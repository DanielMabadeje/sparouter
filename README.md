## SPARouter

SPARouter is a very light-weight javascript plugin basically for routing front-end for single page applications.
SPARouter allows you to create routes in your front-end whether it is a Single Page Application or not
and pass function you would  want to execute if these routes are matched.

## Installation

You can install SPARouter by hosting it locally or by cdn

-   via npm  
    `npm install @kodnificent/sparouter`
-   via cdn  
    Include this code just before the closing head tag of your html page  

**For develpment use only**  
`<script src="https://unpkg.com/@kodnificent/sparouter@1.0.3/dist/sparouter.js"></script>`  

**For production use**  
`<script src="https://unpkg.com/@kodnificent/sparouter@1.0.3/dist/sparouter.min.js"></script>`

## BasicUsage

Use SPARouter through these easy steps.

-   first create a new instance of the `SPARouter` class by passing options to it.  
-   Call the `router.get()` method for each route and add it's callback function to it.
-   Call `router.notFoundHandler()` to add a callback function it no route was matched. i.e 404 handler
-   Finally call the `router.init()` to initialize the router.

### Examples

```javascript
import SPARouter from "@kodnificent/sparouter"; // if you are hosting locally
const options = {
historyMode : true // set this to true if you use the HTML5 history mode API
}
const router = new SPARouter(options);

router.get("/", function(req, router){

console.log(`Welcome to my home page! The request url is ${req.url}`);
//outputs: Welcome to my home page! The request url is /

}).setName("home");

router.get("/user/{username}", function(req, router){

console.log(`Showing profile for ${req.param.username}. To go back home click <a href="${router.pathFor("home")}">here</a>`);
// if url is /user/victor
//ouputs: Showing profile for victor. To go back home click <a href="/">here</a> 

}).setName("user-profile");

router.notFoundHandler(function(){

console.log("oops! the page you are looking for is probably eaten by a snake");
// if user navigates to /wrong-page
//outputs: oops! the page you are looking for is probably eaten by a snake

});
router.init();
```
